## Hi there 😎

I'm Huytutu, currently majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Vietnam National University.

I’m passionate about data science but if you catch me outside class, I’m probably debugging my life instead of Python.

My hobbies include vlogging cinematic slices of life, photography, watching movies, hitting the gym, and playing chess past midnight. 
I also intended to create a social media for sharing tech-related contents (working on it - stay tuned 👀).

In short: I’m just a human trying to train my own brain with fewer bugs than the AI models I work on =)).

Fun facts:
- I read docs pretty fast
- Current favorite book: Tìm Mình Trong Thế Giới Hậu Tuổi Thơ (Đặng Hoàng Giang)
- Current favorite movie: Materialists (2025)
